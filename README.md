# Rust Pairing Heap

An implementation of the [pairing heap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_heap) in Rust.

This was written for my own edification and to ease me into writing Rust. It was quite fun!

This is not intended as a serious, production-ready library. That said, feel free to submit issues, send pull requests and so on
in order to bring it closer to being a serious, production-ready library.

If you do use this library in your own code, please let me know. I'll be quite interested in seeing what you do with it.
